1. Getting natural language text in an input file.

2. Extracting Keyphrases.

	2.1 Step words removal. Tokenization. 

	2.2. Making a graph(Undirected and unweighted) out of the token stream. A vertex in a graph is either 1-gram or 2-gram or n-gram. We then provide each vertex of the graph an initial score 1 and the ranking algorihtm is run on the graph for several iterations till convergene(0.0001).

		2.2.1 The ranking algorithm is a way of deciding the importance of a vertex within a graph, based on global information recursively drawn from the entire graph. The ranking algorithm decides a score as the equation given by (Brin and Page, 1998). 

		Overall:
		i. Identify text units that best define the task at hand, and add them as vertices in the graph.   
		
		ii. Identify relations that connect such text units, and use these relations to draw edges between vertices in the graph. Edges can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted.
		(Section 3.1 in Mihalcea et. al)
		iii. Iterate the graph-based ranking algorithm until convergence. (Section 3.1 in Mihalcea et. al)

	2.3 Vertices are sorted in order of score and top T vertices are chosen as keyphrase. 	


3. Selecting Images for the pictuable keyphrases.

4. Placing the images as given constraints.

5. Producing the image.
